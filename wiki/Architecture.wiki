= General overview =

We tried to make a modularized system (each module is called -surprise- plugin, and can be hot deployed and hot removed) driven by a event system. Each time a module wants to comunicate with others, it does thought an event.

The core of the system is the Engine and the PluginManager.
The engine handles all the subscription and dispachtes all the events (including the xmpp stanzas).
The pluginManager is the one who performs the plugin deploy and removal.

All this complexity is hidden by a facade class call XMPP. *Normally yo dont have to access other parts of the system but XMPP facade*
