== I'm new with Java and/or GWT, how can I ... ==

You can first read and play a little bit with GWT for instance with the [http://code.google.com/webtoolkit/gettingstarted.html Getting Started with GWT], and try to run the GWT Samples. After that try to build, install a run our emite samples.

== I need to install a xmpp server? ==

Well you can play with a proxy to rewrite the bosh petitions, because you have to respect the [http://code.google.com/support/bin/answer.py?answer=77865&topic=13006 same origin policy]. Also see our Server Compatibility Matrix.

== Do you will support in the future XEP-XXXX ==

Maybe, see our issue/enhancement list. Emite is very modular and easy to extend, patches are welcome.

== How can I help? ==

See our issue list, and maybe subscribe to our devel list. Patches are welcome.

== But, emite scales? ==

If you BOSH connector scales, and your xmpp server scales, ((e)) scales.
