Well you can use a proxy to resend the bosh petitions, to another server. But you have to respect the [http://code.google.com/support/bin/answer.py?answer=77865&topic=13006 same origin policy]. Also see our [http://code.google.com/p/emite/wiki/ServerAndClientsCompatibility Server and Client Compatibility Matrix].
