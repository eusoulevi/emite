== I'm new with Java and/or GWT, how can I ... ? ==

You can first read and play a little bit with GWT for instance with the [http://code.google.com/webtoolkit/gettingstarted.html Getting Started with GWT], and try to run the GWT Samples. After that try to build, install a run our emite samples. A recommended read also, [http://catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html How To Ask Questions The Smart Way].

== I need to install a xmpp server? ==

Well you can use a proxy to resend the bosh petitions, to another server. But you have to respect the [http://code.google.com/support/bin/answer.py?answer=77865&topic=13006 same origin policy]. Also see our [http://code.google.com/p/emite/wiki/ServerCompatibility Server Compatibility Matrix].

== What kind of authentication types emite supports? ==

Sorry, initially we only support PLAIN authentication. Be carefull then with your accounts info.

== Do you will support in the future XEP-XXXX or foo feature? ==

Maybe, see our [http://code.google.com/p/emite/issues/list issue/enhancement list]. Emite is very modular and easy to extend, patches are welcome.

== In emiteui there is a bug, what can I do? ==

Please add <code>?log_level=DEBUG</code> to the url (if you are using the ui) and try to fill us an [http://code.google.com/p/emite/issues/list issue] with some debug info.

== How can I help? ==

See our [http://code.google.com/p/emite/issues/list issue list], and maybe subscribe to our devel list. Patches are welcome.

== But, emite scales? ==

If you BOSH connector scales, and your xmpp server scales, ((e)) scales.
