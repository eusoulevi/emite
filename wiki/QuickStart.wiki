#summary How to get the example running



= Introduction =

Bundled with the library there is a gwt ui example.

You need a running xmpp server with bosh connection linked to localhost:8181/http-bind (i will change this in the near future) as pre-requisites (openfire is the easyiest way to obtain that).


get the source code.

inside the project folder type:
{{{
mvn gwt:compile
}}}
to compile the sources
and, if you use a linux envirorment, write:
{{{
./script/server
}}}
to copy the compiled js to the destination folder and run the proxy servlet


if you are not unix', take a look to the script to know which are
the folders you have to copy and then 
{{{
mvn jetty:run
}}}
to run the proxy
