#summary Troubleshooting information for emite

= Emite Troubleshooting =

== I'm using firefox in debian/ubuntu and I can't hear sounds when a message arrives to emiteui, what can I do? ==

apt-get install mozilla-mplayer # it works for us...

== I get a 502 error using emite with Apache and mod_proxy == 

Apache applies its {{{Timeout}}} directive to BOSH/http-bind connections made through mod_proxy and kills such connections after the Timeout expires. In order to prevent this please remove the Timeout directive from your httpd.conf file, or use a higger value.

== I can not use MUC (rooms) with emite and ejabberd ==
You have to edit ejabberd.cnf and remove the comments (%%) in the muc section.
this is an example of a valid configuration frament (using 'rooms' instead of the traditional 'conference' for the MUC domain)
{{{
  {mod_muc,      [
                  {host, "rooms.@HOST@"},
                  {access, muc},
                  {access_create, muc},
                  {access_persistent, muc},
                  {access_admin, muc_admin}
                 ]},
  
}}}
