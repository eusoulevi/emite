== I'm using firefox in debian/ubuntu and I can't hear sounds when a message arrives to emiteui, what can I do? ==

apt-get install mozilla-mplayer # it works for us...

== I get a 502 error using emite with Apache and mod_proxy == 

Apache applies its {{{Timeout}}} directive to BOSH/http-bind connections made through mod_proxy and kills such connections after the Timeout expires. In order to prevent this please remove the Timeout directive from your httpd.conf file, or use a higger value.
